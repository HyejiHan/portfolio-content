    <h1>My Favorite Eats in San Francisco</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
  <p>Here are some restaurant recommendations that I would make if you were to visit San Francisco.</p>
  <p>In San Francisco, there is one of the biggest Chinatown across the states, you can try real Chinesefood like Dimsum!</p>
  <p>Also, not to mention that, San Francisco is bay area,it should not be a surprise that San Francisco has some of the best clam chowder in the world. </p> 
  <p>Thrid one is Mama's on Washington Square - this is a must place to enjoy a delicious breakfast. Be prepared for a long line up.</p>
  <p>I would not forget to mention my favorite burger which is In-N-Out Burger. The meat, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese are all so fresh!</p>
  <p>After a big meal, Are you ready with some dessert? This is Salt&Straw's ice creams. They have every classic flavor of ice cream which is handmade from locally sourced ingredients.</p>
  <p>Are you ready for a dinner? I would recommend Foreign Cinema that is a one-of-a-kind, nationally recognized restaurant that combines independent cinema with California-Mediterranean cuisine. </p>
  <p>Second restaurant that can be considered for dinner is Sotto Mare which is San Franciscos' Best Italian Seafood Restaurant. Highly recommend to try Crab Cioppino.</p>
